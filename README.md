## PROBLEM STATEMENT

<img src="http://www.travel-images.com/pht/france957.jpg">



* Bluecars are an electric ride sharing company based in France.

*Autolib' was an electric car sharing service which was inaugurated in Paris, France, in December 2011.

 It closed on 31 July 2018 

*This project was commisioned with the inntent of analysing bluecar ride sharing data from

Paris, France.

* I was supposed to delve into the datasets provided and analyse the patterns revolving around

picking and returning Bluecars from stations.

* The goal is to come up with insights from the data. These insights would then form a basis for

 recommendation system.

* At the same time, I was supposed to compare the ride patterns of BlueCars to those

 of Utilib electric cars, a competitor in the same industry in Paris, France.

* The recommendation system would serve as a company plan to increase revenue as well as improving

 services in the most popular car stations as well as concentrating client outreach

 at the most popular ride sharing hours.

*This project details  how I approached this problem and came up with insights and 
 
 a basis for  recommendations I later made. 

*The project goes from Data Loading, Data Cleaning and understanding while exclusion and inclusion procedures are 

outlined. I use the CRISP DM Methodology to approach the project.

*The CRISP DM methodology helps break down the problem statement  into bits which are then 

 relatively easier to approach.

## Data Used

* The data used over the course of this project is provided by Bluecar and can be accessed

 from my project documentation.

* There are 2 datasets, 1 of which is a Bluecar Counter  dataset with 25 columns

 while the other file is a glossary detailing the context of the columns. 

## Technologies Used

* I Used Google Colab as my work environment. I also used Jira, a Kanban board to

 keep track of the project tasks.
 
* I found both Google colab and Jira to be great tools to implement the Data Science project since they were
   
  easier to link with resources and platforms such as GITHUB.

## Support

*Contact Nelson Muteti : nelsonmuteti012@gmail.com for any clarification.

*No need to request permission to fork this project.

*Suggestions on improvement are welcome.
